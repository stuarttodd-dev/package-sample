# Package Sample Repository

Welcome to the **Package Sample Repository**! This project aims to help developers by providing a solid foundation for creating and maintaining PHP packages. The goal behind this repository is to simplify technical tests while showcasing your skills in building effective PHP packages.

## Features

- **Docker Support**: This package includes a sample Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy development and testing. Please ensure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed to get started.

- **Composer Scripts**: Leverage Composer for dependency management. The repository comes with useful Composer scripts, including:
  - `phpcs`: For checking coding standards.
  - `phpmd`: For code analysis.
  - `phpstan`: For static analysis.
  - `rector`: For automated code upgrades and refactoring.
  
- **Automated Testing**: A GitHub Actions workflow is set up to automatically run tests whenever you push to the repository, ensuring your code remains reliable and up to standards.

- **Editable Code**: You can modify the code in the `src` directory and add your own unit tests in the `tests` directory to extend functionality.

- **GitHub Template**: The repository includes a template for pull requests that you can customise to fit your project needs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:stuarttodd-dev/package-sample.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to repo**:
   ```
   cd package-sample
   ```

3. **Set Up Docker**:
   Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running. Build Docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

4. **Spin up Docker Container**:
   Run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**:
   Inside your Docker container, install the project dependencies using Composer:
   ```
   docker exec php-composer-package composer install
   ```

6. **Run the Standards Check**:
   Execute the following command to check coding standards, static analysis, and run tests:
   ```
   docker exec php-composer-package composer standards:check
   ```

 7. **Run Tests**:
   Execute the following command to check coding standards, static analysis, and run tests:
   ```
   docker exec php-composer-package composer tests
   ```

## Sharing Your Package

To make your package publicly accessible, you can either add it to **Packagist** for installation via Composer or adjust your composer.json file to include the VCS URL:

### Option 1. Add to Packagist

Submit your package to [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org).

### Option 2. Add VCS Line in Composer

Adjust your composer.json file to include the VCS URL, e.g to include this:
```
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/package-sample.git" 
        }
    ]
}
```

## Tagging Your Releases

To create a new release for your package, you can tag your repository using the following commands:

1. Create a new tag:
   ```
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   ```
3. Push the tag to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
   
## Conclusion

This repository serves as a foundation for creating a PHP package, making it easier for you to develop, test, and maintain your projects. Feel free to modify the code and templates to suit your needs!
